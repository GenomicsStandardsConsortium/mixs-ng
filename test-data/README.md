# Test Data Directory

This directory contains JSON Documents for testing the MIxS JSON Schema implmentation.

## Naming convention

Each file name has prefix `valid` or `invalid` followed by description of the teast data content.

`valid` files should always result in correct validation. files with prefix `invalid` should always fail the validation.
